This is code for Project "Effect of Noise in Neural Network Training"

Where effect of noise in Neural Network is analysis on effect 1. Reduce overfit 2. accelerate training 3. protect privacy

Noise can be added on 1.gradient 2.training data 3.neural network parameter. and effect could be slightly different.
